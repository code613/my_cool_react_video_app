This is a front end web app with React and Axios using Youtube's API to search and play video's as well as displays relevant information.
It is based off of a project from this course https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/ .
As of now the API can only be run on localhost:3000 (the code can be downloaded and then run with npm start).
The plan for the future is to add this to my website.
PR's are welcome ;-)
